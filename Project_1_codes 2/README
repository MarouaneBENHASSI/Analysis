The ALICE experiment at CERN LHC was designed to study heavy ion collisions as well as proton collisions. Electromagnetic interactions are present in such collisions; The electromagnetic field of a charged particle moving at ultrarelativistic velocities can be considered as a photon cloud that surrounds the particle. The photon cloud of a projectile nucleus can interact with the entire target nucleus, its constituents or its photon cloud, giving as result the production of new particles. To distinguish these processes from hadronic processes a condition in the impact parameter is required, it must be bigger than the raddi sum of colliding particles. Collisions that met this requirement are called ultraperipheral. The study of τ-τ photoproduction at ALICE in ultraperiperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at \sqrt{S_{NN}} = 5.02 TeV is presented.
